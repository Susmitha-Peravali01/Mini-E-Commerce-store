## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To set up the Mini E-Commerce Store locally, begin by installing and launching XAMPP to run the Apache and MySQL services. 
Download or clone the project repository and place it inside the `htdocs` directory (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/mini-ecommerce-store`).
Next, open phpMyAdmin and create a new database—commonly named `MiniEcommerceStore`—then import the provided `.sql` files located in the project’s database folder. 
Update the database credentials in the configuration file with your local settings, typically using `localhost`, `root` as the username, and a blank password. 
Finally, launch the application by visiting [http://localhost/mini-ecommerce-store](http://localhost/mini-ecommerce-store) in your web browser to access the home page and begin exploring the platform.
